Orthogram
=========

**WARNING:** *This is work in progress.  There is no guarantee as to
the stability and reliability of this program.*

Orthogram is a command line program and Python library that lets you
draw diagrams of graphs.  It reads a YAML file and produces a SVG file
like this one:

.. image:: examples/powerplant.svg
   :width: 100%

Orthogram does not aim to be a fully-featured graph layout solution.
Actually, it offers just a single layout: grid.  More than that, you
have to arrange the connected objects manually in the grid and they
stay fixed in place; the program will not attempt to move them around
trying to optimize any aspect of the diagram.  Styling is also rather
basic at the moment.  It does however try to do a decent job arranging
the connections around the objects to produce a tidy, readable
drawing.

When used as a command line tool, Orthogram reads a *diagram
definition file* and produces a Scalable Vector Graphics file.  The
definition file is written in YAML.

Installation
------------

You must have Python 3.8 or newer installed in your system.  Run the
following command to install package ``orthogram`` from PyPi:

.. code:: console

   python -m pip install orthogram

Note however that some of Orthogram's dependencies rely on C/C++
libraries that you may have to install on your system:

=================  ===========
Python Package     Library
=================  ===========
``python-igraph``  igraph
``pyyaml``         LibYAML
``shapely``        GEOS
=================  ===========

Command line interface
----------------------

The ``orthogram`` module is designed to be used from the command line.
To generate a drawing of a diagram defined in a `diagram definition
file`_ named ``diagram.yaml``, enter the following command:

.. code:: console

   python -m orthogram diagram.yaml

This will create a ``diagram.svg`` file in the same directory.  If you
wish to create a file with a different name or in a different
directory, pass the path as a second argument.

The program creates Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files.  Use your
web browser to view the drawing.  Use `Inkscape`_ to convert it to PNG
or other supported formats.

**NOTE:** The character encoding of the definition file must be UTF-8.

.. _Inkscape: https://inkscape.org

Hello world
-----------

Start the text editor of your choice and type in the following lines
of YAML:

.. code:: yaml

   terminals:
     a:
       label: Hello
     b:
       label: world
   rows:
     - pins: [a]
     - pins: ["", b]
   links:
     - start: a
       end: b

Save it as ``hello.yaml`` and run:

.. code:: console

   python -m orthogram hello.yaml

This should create a ``hello.svg`` file in the same directory.

Diagram definition file
-----------------------

Orthogram uses YAML for its input file format.  Of course, YAML being
a superset of JSON, you can use JSON if you prefer so.  The top-level
structure must be a YAML mapping; the following keys are recognized,
each one containing a different category of definitions:

* ``diagram``
* ``terminals``
* ``rows``
* ``links``
* ``styles``
* ``groups``

``diagram``
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``diagram`` section contains the `attributes`_ of the diagram
itself.  It is entirely optional; you do not need one if you do not
intend to customize your diagram.  Here is an example of a ``diagram``
section:

.. code:: yaml

   diagram:
     label: This is my diagram!
     font_weight: bold

The following diagram attributes are of particular significance:

``collapse_links``
  If you set this to ``true``, collinear segments of links belonging
  to the same ``group`` will collapse into a single segment.  This may
  help reduce the clutter, though it depends on the application.  Try
  it out and see.

``stretch``
  By default, the diagram resizes itself to fill the element that
  contains it.  Set this attribute to ``false`` to make the browser
  render the diagram in its original dimensions.

``terminals``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``terminals`` section contains mappings between terminal names and
terminal definitions.  You must have at least a couple of terminals to
produce a meaningful diagram.  Here is an example:

.. code:: yaml

   terminals:
     a:
       label: A terminal
     b:
       label: Another terminal
       stroke: blue

If you want a label with more than one line of text, use the newline
character in the string.  Even better, you can use the YAML literal
style:

.. code:: yaml

   terminals:

     single-line:
       label: A single line label

     multi-with-newlines:
       label: Two lines separated by\na newline character

     multi-with-newlines-again:
       label: |-
         You can also use
         YAML literal style

Note that if the label of a terminal is not defined, the name of the
terminal is used as a label instead.

``rows``
~~~~~~~~

The ``rows`` section of the diagram definition file is used to arrange
the terminals in the layout grid.  It is essential; terminals that
have not been placed in the grid are not drawn at all.

The ``rows`` structure is a sequence of row definitions.  Each row
definition contains a sequence of terminal names.  You can use an
empty string between the terminal names to leave an empty spot in the
row.  Here is an example:

.. code:: yaml

   terminals:
     a:
     b:
     c:
   rows:
     - pins: [a]
     - pins: [b, "", c]

Note that the ``pins`` key is necessary.  Row definitions do not have
any attributes, though this may change in the future.

A terminal can have many pins in multiple rows as long as the area
they occupy in the grid is rectangular.  This way you can draw
terminals that span multiple diagram rows or columns.  The following
example contains valid arrangements:

.. code:: yaml

   rows:
     - pins: [a, b , b , c, c]
     - pins: [a, "", "", c, c]

However, the program will reject the following invalid arrangements:

.. code:: yaml

   # These are wrong!  Terminal 'a' has a gap; terminal 'b' is
   # L-shaped.
   rows:
     - pins: [a , "", a , b, ""]
     - pins: ["", "", "", b, b ]

``links``
~~~~~~~~~

The ``links`` section defines the connections between the terminals.
It is a sequence of link definitions. Each link must declare the names
of the ``start`` and ``end`` terminals, as well as any `attributes`_
appropriate for links.  Note that the terminals must have at least one
pin placed before making a connection. Here is an example:

.. code:: yaml

   terminals:
     a: {label: First terminal}
     b: {label: Second terminal}
     c: {label: Third terminal}
   rows:
     - pins: [a,  b]
     - pins: ["", c]
   links:
     - start: a
       end: b
       stroke: blue
     - start: b
       end: c
       stroke: "#FF8844"

Note that the ``start`` and ``end`` values of a link definition can be
*sequences* of terminal names as well.  This lets you make multiple
connections in a single definition, all links sharing the same
attributes.  For example, the following definition creates six links:

.. code:: yaml

   links:
     - start: [a, b]
       end: [c, d, e]

Of particular interest is the ``drawing_priority`` attribute.  Links
with a higher priority number are drawn over links with a lower
priority.  Since the intersection of links cannot typically be avoided
in complex diagrams, it is advised that you draw intersecting links
with a different ``stroke`` color to make obvious that the links are
not connected at the intersection points.  The ``drawing_priority``
lets you draw sets of links as layers on top of each other, giving a
more consistent look to your diagram.

Another way to avoid intersecting links appearing as if the were
connected at the intersections is to draw a *buffer* around the links.
Attributes ``buffer_fill`` and ``buffer_width`` control the appearance
of the buffer.  By default, the program draws the links without a
buffer.

Links may have an additional ``group`` attribute, which works together
with the ``collapse_links`` diagram attribute.  If ``collapse_links``
is set to true, links of the same group that run along the same axis
can be drawn on top of each other, thus reducing the clutter and size
of the diagram.  The ``group`` value is just a string.  Note that
setting this attribute affects the drawing priority of the links.  All
links in the same group must share the same priority, which is the
highest priority among all links in the group.

``styles``
~~~~~~~~~~

You can add style definitions to the ``styles`` section to create
named styles that can be referred to by the terminals and links.  Each
style definition consists of attribute key-value pairs.  For example,
the following two terminals are drawn in the same color:

.. code:: yaml

   terminals:
     a:
       style: reddish
     b:
       style: reddish
   rows:
     - pins: [a, b]
   styles:
     reddish:
       stroke: "#880000"
       stroke_width: 3.0
       fill: "#FFDDDD"

Attributes you define in the element itself override the attributes it
inherits from the linked named style.

There are two special style names, ``default_terminal`` and
``default_link``, which you can use to set default values for all the
terminals and links in the diagram respectively.

``groups``
~~~~~~~~~~

The ``groups`` section may be used to attach attributes to link
groups.  Since links in the same group may collapse on one another, it
is usually desirable for all the links in one group to share the same
attributes.  In the example that follows, all links are drawn in blue:

.. code:: yaml

   groups:
     water:
       stroke: blue
       stroke_width: 4.0
   links:
     - start: a
       end: b
       group: water
     - start: c
       end: d
       group: water

A group definition may contain a reference to a named ``style`` if
needed.  Note that creating an entry in the ``groups`` section is not
necessary for the grouping of the links; a common ``group`` name in
each link definition is sufficient.

API
---

Using the ``Diagram`` class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to create a diagram using Python, you can start by
creating an empty ``Diagram`` object:

.. code:: python

   from orthogram import Diagram, write_svg

   diagram = Diagram(label="A hand-made diagram", text_fill="blue")

You can pass any diagram `attributes`_ to the constructor as key-value
pairs.

You can now add terminals to the diagram:

.. code:: python

   diagram.add_terminal("a", label="Hello")
   diagram.add_terminal("b", label="Beautiful")
   diagram.add_terminal("c", label="World")

Again, you can provide `attributes`_ for the terminals as key-value
pairs.

In order to use the terminals, you must first place pins for them in
the grid:

.. code:: python

   diagram.add_row(["a"])
   diagram.add_row(["b", "", "c"])

The ``add_row`` method takes a list of terminal names.  Note that you
must have added the terminals to the diagram before placing pins for
them in the grid.  Use an empty string or None to leave an empty space
between terminals.

After placing the terminals, you can connect them via links like this:

.. code:: python

   diagram.add_link("a", "b", stroke="red")

Note that the ``Diagram`` class offers an ``add_links`` method as
well, which lets you create links en masse (all having the same
attributes).

After you have finished building your diagram, use the ``write_svg()``
function to write the SVG file:

.. code:: python

   write_svg(diagram, "hello.svg")

Using the ``Builder`` class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Builder`` class lets you create ``Diagram`` objects from Python
dictionaries like the ones you load from a YAML file.  The ``add()``
method imports a complete diagram definition into the builder:

.. code:: python

   import yaml
   from orthogram import Builder, write_svg

   builder = Builder()
   with open("diagram.yaml") as f:
       data = yaml.safe_load(f)
       builder.add(data)
   write_svg(builder.diagram, "diagram.svg")

If you have to be more specific, ``Builder`` provides the following
methods:

=======================  ===================
Do one                   Do many
=======================  ===================
``add_style()``          ``add_styles()``
``add_group()``          ``add_groups()``
``add_terminal()``       ``add_terminals()``
``add_row()``            ``add_rows()``
``add_link()``           ``add_links()``
``configure_diagram()``
=======================  ===================

For example:

.. code:: python

   terminal_def = {
       'label': "Hello",
       'fill': "yellow",
       'stroke': "none",
   }
   builder.add_terminal('hello', terminal_def)

Use the ``help()`` Python function to read the documentation of each
method.  Note that you have to do the imports in a logical order: you
must import the styles before using them, place the pins before
linking the terminals etc.

The ``diagram`` property of a ``Builder`` object holds the diagram
which is being built.  If you want to use the ``Diagram`` API on it,
as described in the previous section, after or while using the
builder, you can certainly do so.

Convenience functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``load_ddf()`` and ``translate()`` functions are provided as
shortcuts:

.. code:: python

   from orthogram import load_ddf, translate, write_svg

   # You can do this:
   diagram = load_ddf("diagram.yaml")
   write_svg(diagram, "diagram.svg")

   # or just this:
   translate("diagram.yaml", "diagram.svg")

Acknowledgements
----------------

This program depends on the following excellent pieces of software:

* `Python`_: The author's preferred programming language.  Flexible,
  convenient and nice to look at.  Has a library for everything.

* `python-igraph`_: Python interface to the powerful `igraph`_
  library.  Orthogram uses it everywhere in its layout engine.  The
  performance offered by the C-based implementation is much needed.

* `pyyaml`_: Simple to use, efficient YAML parser.

* `shapely`_: Python interface to the powerful `GEOS`_ geometry
  library.  A bit overkill for the simple geometry manipulations
  Orthogram does, but why reinvent the wheel?

* `svgwrite`_: Orthogram uses this library to write the SVG files.
  Much better than having to use straight XML!

The following programs improved the development experience of the
author a lot:

* `mypy`_: Python static analyzer.  Makes refactoring so much easier.

* `Poetry`_: Great Python package manager.  Also made publishing to
  PyPI a breeze.
