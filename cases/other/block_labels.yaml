blocks:

  - tags: [A, B]
    label_position: bottom
    label: |-
      The same must happen to this block,
      which surrounds the two others.

  - name: A
    label: "Min. size"

  - name: B
    label: |-
      This block must expand
      in both directions,
      so that it is large enough
      for the label inside it.
