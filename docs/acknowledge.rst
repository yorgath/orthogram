================

This program depends on the following excellent pieces of software:

* `Python`_: The author's preferred programming language.  Flexible,
  convenient and nice to look at.  Has a library for everything.

* `NetworkX`_: Very comprehensive network analysis library.
  Implemented in pure Python, so easy to install and convenient to
  use.

* `Shapely`_: Python interface to the powerful `GEOS`_ geometry
  library.  A bit overkill for the simple geometry manipulations
  Orthogram does, but why reinvent the wheel?

* `svgwrite`_: Orthogram uses this library to write the SVG files.
  Much better than having to use straight XML!

* `pyyaml`_: Simple to use, efficient YAML parser.

* `Sphinx`_: The Python documentation generator.

The following programs improved the development experience of the
author a lot:

* `mypy`_: Python static analyzer.  Makes refactoring so much easier.

* `Poetry`_: Great Python package manager.  Also made publishing to
  PyPI a breeze.
